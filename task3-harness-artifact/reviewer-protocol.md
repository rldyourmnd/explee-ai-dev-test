# Reviewer Protocol

Reviewer tracks are designed to run as parallel subagents when `ry-review` or an explicit-review `ry-start` request invokes the review phase. They live as `agents/flow-*-review.md` (not skills) per Claude Code May-2026 best practice for orchestrated-only review tracks.

## Subagent Permission

The user explicitly approves subagent usage through `/ry-review` or through `/ry-start` only when the prompt also asks for review, audit, security review, rules review, or reviewer subagents. Each spawned subagent must receive a self-contained prompt with task, scope, diff, constraints, expected output, and read-only status.

## Tracks

| Track | Agent | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | `flow-architecture-review` | boundaries, dependencies, module shape, data flow |
| Quality | `flow-quality-review` | correctness, hacks, tech debt, edge cases, error handling |
| Consistency | `flow-consistency-review` | conventions, naming, style, file placement, public API shape |
| Integration | `flow-integration-review` | cross-module synchronization, contracts, migrations, configs |
| Verification | `flow-verification-review` | tests, manual checks, browser/server evidence, quality gates |
| Security | `flow-security-review` | security-sensitive paths, OWASP, secrets, auth/authz, unsafe flows |

## Finding Format

Each finding must include:

- Severity: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `info`. `info` is reserved for hardening notes and architectural observations without a concrete fix obligation.
- Confidence: `0-100`.
- Location: file and line when possible.
- Evidence: concrete code or behavior.
- Impact: what fails or becomes harder.
- Fix: actionable correction (omit or write "n/a" for `info` entries).
- Disposition: `must-fix`, `should-fix`, `defer`, or `false-positive`.

`flow-security-review` findings add `Category` (OWASP/ASVS class), `Attack path` (defensive, no weaponization), and `Verification` (test or check) fields.

Do not report confidence below 30. Validate confidence 30-49 in the parent workflow before acting.

## Output Transport

Claude Code 2.0.77+ has a confirmed regression where `task.output` from a subagent can be returned to the parent session as a full JSONL transcript instead of the final assistant text. Anthropic issues [`#16789`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16789), [`#20531`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/20531), [`#23463`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23463) are closed as "not planned"; combined subagent results (7 × ~20-30 KB each) can overflow the parent context window and crash the session. Anthropic's documented sub-agents guidance also states subagents should return only a summary.

To stay safe regardless of upstream behavior, every reviewer subagent in this marketplace uses a **file-first output contract** instead of inline-markdown-only returns.

### Run ID and report directory

The explicit-review orchestrator (`ry-start` or `ry-review` skill body) generates one `run_id` per review wave and passes it inside each reviewer prompt:

```
run_id    = <UTC-ISO-compact>-<git-short-sha>
            e.g. 2026-05-16T1433Z-91cc276    (minute-precision UTC)
report_dir = .serena/reviews/<run_id>/
```

- `report_dir` is a runtime artefact directory, not durable knowledge. It must be ignored by git (`.gitignore: .serena/reviews/`).
- One subdirectory per review wave; one file per reviewer track: `<report_dir>/<reviewer-name>.md` where `<reviewer-name>` is the agent frontmatter `name:` field (e.g. `flow-architecture-review`, `flow-security-review`). Distinct filenames per track prevent collisions when 6+ reviewers run in parallel.
- The orchestrator writes a consolidated `_summary.md` after aggregating reviewer outputs whenever any track reported one or more findings (see "Orchestrator read contract" below).

### Reviewer write contract

Each reviewer:

1. Uses `Bash` (already in the allowlist) to write the full markdown report. **The Bash write must target only `<report_dir>/<reviewer-name>.md`; no other paths.** Reviewers have read-only access to project source via the absence of `Edit`, `Write`, and `NotebookEdit` from the allowlist, but `Bash` is technically arbitrary - the contract bounds it to the single report path. Canonical pattern:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "${report_dir}"
   cat > "${report_dir}/<reviewer-name>.md" <<'RLDYOUR_REPORT_EOF'
   # <Reviewer Title> - <scope>
   ...full long-form findings (Severity / Confidence / Location / Evidence / Impact / Fix / Disposition,
   plus security extras when applicable)...
   RLDYOUR_REPORT_EOF
   ```
   The unique multi-character marker `RLDYOUR_REPORT_EOF` prevents accidental early termination when the report body legitimately contains short tokens like `MD`, `EOF`, or `END`. The closing marker must be at column 0 (no leading whitespace) per bash heredoc rules.
2. Returns to the parent session a **compact summary ≤ 4 KB** with this exact structure:

```
## Review Summary - <reviewer-name>
Report: <relative path to report file from repo root>

Counts: critical=N, high=N, medium=N, low=N, info=N, total=N

All findings (one-liner, cap 30 entries - additional findings only in the report file):
- F-1 <severity> (<confidence>): <relative path>:<line> - <one-sentence description, ≤ 100 chars>
- F-2 ...
- ... (cap 30 entries; append "... +M more findings in report file" when total > 30)

Notes: any blocker, error, or constraint encountered while writing the report.
```

3. If the runtime cannot write to `report_dir` (read-only filesystem, missing permissions, sandbox), the reviewer:
   - Falls back to inline summary-only output without a `Report:` line.
   - Adds `Notes: filesystem-readonly` (or the specific error) so the orchestrator records the limitation.
   - Still respects the 4 KB compact-summary cap and the cap-30 one-liner rule.

### Orchestrator read contract

The explicit-review orchestrator (`ry-start` or `ry-review` skill body) after subagent completion:

1. Reads each reviewer summary from the agent result.
2. Aggregates counts across all reviewers.
3. **Must read each full report file (`Read` tool) for every `critical` and `high` finding** before deciding disposition (`flow-security-review` carries OWASP `Category`, `Attack path`, and `Verification` fields that exist only in the report file). Medium and low findings may be read on demand when the consolidation requires deeper evidence.
4. Resolves contradictions across reviewer tracks against code evidence.
5. Writes `<report_dir>/_summary.md` (consolidated cross-track findings + plan disposition) as durable wave artefact whenever any track reported one or more findings.
6. Reports back to the user in Russian. Lists report-file paths so the user can inspect full findings on disk.

### Why this works

- **Cap on parent context impact**: 6 reviewers × ≤ 4 KB summary = ≤ 24 KB injected into parent context, well below any plausible overflow threshold. The bug class described in Anthropic `#23463` (15-37 KB per reviewer × 7 reviewers → 150 KB → overflow) is structurally prevented.
- **Full evidence preserved**: long-form findings live on disk and are not lost even when subagent transport truncates.
- **Backward compatible**: reviewers that find few findings produce short summaries; the file is optional metadata, the summary alone is sufficient for the orchestrator to act.
- **Read-only invariant intact**: reviewers still only modify their own report files under `.serena/reviews/` - they do not touch project source. The marketplace `validate_agent_tools.py` invariant continues to allow `Bash` for read-only inspection plus reviewer-result writes; project files remain unreachable because `Edit`, `Write`, and `NotebookEdit` are absent from the allowlist.

## Parent Integration

The parent explicit-review workflow (`ry-start` or `ry-review`) consolidates all findings, resolves contradictions with code evidence, fixes accepted findings, then reruns only the reviewer tracks that found problems.

## Why agents, not skills

As of May 2026, `disable-model-invocation: true` on plugin skills has known limitations (cannot be invoked by user via slash command either when installed in a plugin - issue #26251). The canonical pattern from `anthropics/claude-plugins-official/plugins/pr-review-toolkit` is reviewer **agents**, not skills. Reviewer agents have:

- Short orchestration-focused descriptions (no "use when..." trigger phrases) to discourage implicit invocation.
- `tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, mcp__plugin_rldyour-mcps_serena__*, mcp__plugin_rldyour-mcps_context7__*, mcp__plugin_rldyour-mcps_deepwiki__*, mcp__plugin_rldyour-mcps_grep__*]` explicit allowlist to enforce read-only review with future-proof safety. `flow-security-review` adds `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` for CVE lookups; SAST evidence comes from project security scripts and CI artifacts. Pattern follows canonical `anthropics/claude-plugins-official/plugins/pr-review-toolkit/agents/code-reviewer` (explicit allowlist), not the older `disallowedTools` denylist - explicit positive intent is stronger than denying a finite list.
- `model: sonnet` for cost-efficiency on read-only inspection work.
- `effort: high` (uniform across all 6 tracks).
- `maxTurns: 90` for standard tracks; `100` for `flow-security-review` (extra turns reserved for variant-hunt sweep - searching sibling files and repeated helpers for the same root cause once an issue is found). Generous limits compensate for MCP-rich toolsets (Serena + Context7 + DeepWiki + Grep) consuming turns on tool plumbing - tight 12-14 caps left only 4-7 effective reasoning turns. When adding a new reviewer track, default to `maxTurns: 90` unless the track requires variant-hunting beyond the single finding.
- Distinct `color` per track for visual differentiation in the task list:
  - `flow-architecture-review`: `blue`
  - `flow-quality-review`: `green`
  - `flow-consistency-review`: `purple`
  - `flow-integration-review`: `orange`
  - `flow-verification-review`: `pink`
  - `flow-security-review`: `red`

Explicit-review orchestrators (`ry-start`, `ry-review`) invoke them via prose body delegation in their workflow steps.
